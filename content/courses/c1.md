## Syllabus

The module aims to familiarize the student with the essential services provided by modern clouds on the example of Amazon Web Services. Next, students will create a capstone project on top of AWS. During the course, the student will analyze features such as scalability, high availability, security, or aspects related to the economic costs of modern cloud solutions.
